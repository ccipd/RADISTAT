# RADIomic Spatial TexturAl descripTor (RADISTAT)

RADISTAT is a novel radiomic approach driven by the hypothesis that quantifying spatial organization of texture patterns within an ROI could allow for better capturing interactions between different tissue classes present in a given region; thus enabling more accurate characterization of disease or response phenotypes.

Reference MATLAB and Python implementations of RADISTAT are provided.
